		<p>This was the first film in the 69th edition of the Cannes International Film Festival to be booed by some of the critics. Other critics gave it rave reviews. In spite of the divisive reactions by the international critics, the film was later well-received by the audience at the premiere, who gave a long standing ovation. <strong>Olivier Assayas</strong> finally won the 'Best Director' award by the 'Official Competition' jury.</p>

	<div>
		<p><strong>Olivier Assayas</strong> describes this as a companion piece of sorts to <strong>Clouds of Sils Maria</strong> (2014). In both films, <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong> plays a woman on the fringes of wealth and celebrity.</p>  
	</div> 

	<div>
		<p><strong>Olivier Assayas</strong> didn't originally intend to make two consecutive films with <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong>. However, in 2015 he was working on a American production, which fell apart and subsequently created the script for this film in a short matter of time. In an interview, Assayas said he didn't think he would've written the Personal Shopper screenplay if he hadn't known Stewart. </p>

		<p>Stewart and the crew were filming in Paris and left to start filming in Prague just 48 hours before the 2015 Paris attacks. They were together when the news broke on TV with many of the crew frantically making phone calls to check on the safety of family and friends.</p>

		<p><strong>Kristen Stewart</strong>, <strong>Lars Eidinger</strong>, <strong>Nora von Waldstätten</strong> and <strong>Benoit Peverelli</strong> previously co-starred in <strong>Olivier Assayas</strong>' <strong>Clouds of Sils Maria</strong> (2014). Waldstätten and <strong>Olivia Ross</strong> also co-starred in Assayas' <strong>Carlos</strong> (2010).
